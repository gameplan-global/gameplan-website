<p>
    It's important to understand the difference between task management tools and project scheduling tools.
</p>
<p>
    With task management tools you create tasks and assign task due dates.
    These tools shows when tasks are due, but give no indication if the dates are achievable.
    When a delay occurs, these tools tell you that you're late, but they can't help you further.
</p>
<p>
    Project scheduling tools look at task effort and team availability, and they calculate the entire project timeline.
    When a delay occurs, the project timeline is recalculated, showing you how the delay impacts your project.
</p>
<p>
    Task management tools work well when a project is NOT time sensitive.
    However, if time is important, only scheduling tools show you what is achievable and keep you on track to meet your project deliverables.
