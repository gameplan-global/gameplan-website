You plan your project by drawing your project workflow on the GamePlan Whiteboard.
As you plan, the project schedule automatically updates and is displayed in a Gantt chart.
Only GamePlan delivers true resource-leveled project scheduling through a visual Whiteboard user experience.

Beware of task mangagement tools (Asana, Monday, Trello,...) that show a Gantt chart. In these tools the start and end dates are entered by the user.  This is dangerous because when people see a Gantt chart, they believe it is achievable.  When it isn’t, due dates are missed and the team is stressed trying to meet unachievable deadlines.

GamePlan’s Gantt chart is created by GamePlan's proprietary algorithms which create a schedule that is optimized and achievable.
