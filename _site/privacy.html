<ol>
  <li>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</li>
</ol>

<p>GamePlan may collect and use personal and non-personal information from you when you access or use the Service. In this section of the Policy, we will describe the type of information that may be collected and how that information may be used.</p>

<p>2.2 Non-Personal information</p>

<p>For the purpose of this Policy, “non-personal information” means: (1) information that does not directly identify you; and (2) “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data GamePlan collects about the use of the Service from which personally identifiable information has been removed.</p>
