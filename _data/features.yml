      - Achieving your deliverables on time is critical for any new business. A project schedule shows exactly when you will deliver based on your team size and their availability. 
      - As you visually plan on the Whiteboard, a resource-leveled schedule is automatically created and presented on the GamePlan Gantt chart.  This shows you if due dates are achievable.

    text:
      - New businesses typically have limited funds to spend before they need to make a profit or do their next financing.  Therefore, it is critical to accurately forecast costs and to stay on budget.
      - GamePlan calculates how much projects will cost so you can create realistic budgets. GamePlan also creates cost schedules that show when expenses will be incurred.
      - When there are changes to a project, GamePlan shows how the project cost is affected.

  - title: Project Communication
    text:
      - In a new business you need to communicate business plans internally with your team, to the board, and to current and potential investors.
      - Everyone understands a plan in GamePlan because it is presented visually on the GamePlan Whiteboard.
      - Understanding the plan promotes buy-in from the team, encourages relevant questions from the board, and gives investors confidence in the business.

  - title: Project Tracking
    text: 
      - There are unknowns with any new business, and often these unknowns cause delays.  GamePlan immediately shows how any delay affects your deliverable dates.  
      - If due dates cannot slide, you can easily test changes to your plan, such as adding staff or reducing scope.
      - GamePlan gives you the information you need to bring your deliverable dates back on time.
