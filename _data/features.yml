  - title: Project Scheduling
    text: Achieving your deliverables on time is critical for any new business.  A project schedule shows exactly when you will deliver based on your team size and their availability.  In GamePlan, as you visually plan on the Whiteboard, a resource-leveled schedule is automatically created.  This shows you if given due dates are achievable.
