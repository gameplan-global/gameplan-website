# FAQ data
#--------------------
faqs:
  - question: "Can everyone on the product launch team access the plan online?"
    answer: "Yes, and you control their access permission.  For example, 'timesheet' permission lets them view the plan, set tasks complete, and enter timesheets."
  - question: "Do people that I share the plan with need to pay for GamePlan?"
    answer: "No, Viewer licenses for GamePlan are free.  A Viewer license still allows people to set tasks complete and enter timesheets, so you can track their progress."
  - question: "Can I get the product launch plan shown in the images above?"
    answer: "Yes, however please note that this is a high level plan that only contains marketing tasks.  Also, task effort has not been estimated.  However, it is still a good example of how to use GamePlan.  Please contact us through the website and we'll share it with you."
  - question: "Do I need special hardware to use GamePlan?"
    answer: "GamePlan requires a personal computer, either PC or Mac.  Tablets are not yet supported.  Like all graphical applications, you should use an external mouse.  Because GamePlan is a cloud application, an internet connection is required."
  - question: "Which applications can GamePlan import data from?"
    answer: "GamePlan can import data from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, and from Primavera P6 through a XER file."

<p class="u-fs-22">
    Many departments are involved in a product launch, so you need one plan that each department contributes to.  In GamePlan, each department plans on their own virtual Whiteboard, and all Whiteboards contribute to the overall project plan.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Everyone understands the project plan because it\'s visual.  Teams stay focussed on completing their tasks because they know their impact on the launch.
</p>

            Benefits of planning
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning makes you consider all aspects of a project, which results in far fewer surprises later.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning shows the project\'s critical path in red arrows.  These are the tasks that will impact the launch date if they run late.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The visual plan is a very effective communication tool.

    title="Scheduling"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    As you visually plan, GamePlan creates a resource-leveled project schedule.  The schedule is achievable because each person\'s availability is considered and no one is double-booked.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    The project schedule is shown in the Gantt chart immediately below the Whiteboard.
</p>

            Benefits of Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows you the earliest possible product launch date given the work required and each person\'s availability.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows everyone exactly when they need to start and finish their tasks in order to keep the product launch on time.

    title="Tracking"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Tracking is done by setting tasks as completed or entering timesheets.  Tracking keeps the project plan up to date.

        <h2>
            Benefits of Tracking
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking keeps the schedule valid, so that everyone can rely on the schedule.  When there\'s a delay or when a task takes longer than expected, the downstream schedule updates.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking the project also shows the project status. How far through the project are you?  When will you be ready to launch?  This information and more is always known.
