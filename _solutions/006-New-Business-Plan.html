# FAQ data
#--------------------
faqs:
  - question: "Can everyone on my team access the plan online?"
    answer: "Yes, and you control their access permission.  For example, 'timesheet' permission lets them view the plan, set tasks complete, and enter timesheets."
  - question: "Do people that I share the plan with need to pay for GamePlan?"
    answer: "No, Viewer licenses for GamePlan are free.  A Viewer license still allows people to set tasks complete and enter timesheets, so you can track their progress."
  - question: "Can I get the new business plan shown in the images above?"
    answer: "Yes.  Please contact us through the website and we'll share it with you."
  - question: "Do I need special hardware to use GamePlan?"
    answer: "GamePlan requires a personal computer, either PC or Mac.  Tablets are not yet supported.  Like all graphical applications, you should use an external mouse.  Because GamePlan is a cloud application, an internet connection is required."
  - question: "Which applications can GamePlan import data from?"
    answer: "GamePlan can import data from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, and from Primavera P6 through a XER file."

<p class="u-fs-22">
    Many people are involved in launching a new business, so you need one plan that everyone works from.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    With GamePlan, everyone understands the plan because it\'s visual.  People stay focused on completing their tasks because they know their impact on the business launch date.

            Benefits of planning
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning makes you consider all aspects of the new business ahead of time.  This is critical when so much is at stake.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning also shows the project\'s critical path (with red arrows).  These are the tasks that will impact the business start date if they run late.

    title="Scheduling"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    A schedule is mandatory because without a schedule you don\'t know when the business will be ready to launch, and people don\'t know when they\'re needed.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    GamePlan creates a resource-leveled project schedule as you visually plan, and shows it in a Gantt chart.  This is different to all other products, where you have to create the Gantt chart.  In GamePlan, the Gantt chart is created for you.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">

        <h2>
            Benefits of Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows you the earliest possible business launch date, and it shows people when to start and finish their tasks in order to achieve it.

    title="Tracking"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Once execution of the new business plan starts, tracking is done by setting tasks as completed or entering timesheets.  Tracking keeps the plan and schedule up to date.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">
    <div class="media-body">
        <h2>
            Benefits of Tracking
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking keeps the schedule valid, so that everyone can rely on it.  When there\'s a delay or when a task takes longer than expected, the downstream schedule updates.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking also shows the project status. What is the progress?  When will the new business be ready launch?  This information and more is always known.
