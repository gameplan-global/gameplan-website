# FAQ data
#--------------------
faqs:
  - question: "Can my subcontractors access the plan online?"
    answer: "Yes, if you let them.  You control their access permission so, if you want, they can only view the plan and make no changes to it.  This allows them to see when they are scheduled on your projects."
  - question: "Do my subcontractors need to pay for GamePlan?"
    answer: "No, GamePlan is free for a Viewer license.  A Viewer license allows them to view shared plans online and also to enter timesheets so that you can track their progress (if you grant them this permission level)."
  - question: "I am building a few homes.  Can I have more than one build in my plan?"
    answer: "Absolutely!  You can have as many as you like.  They will exist on different Whiteboards within the same plan.  And GamePlan's scheduling engine ensures that no one is double booked."
  - question: "Do I have to plan every home build or can I copy an existing plan?"
    answer: "You can copy and paste an existing project to a new project within the same plan or into an entirely new plan."
  - question: "Can I get a copy of the residential construction plan you show in the images above?"
    answer: "Sure.  Just contact us through our website and we'll gladly share it with you.  This will save you time getting started."
  - question: "Do I need special hardware to use GamePlan?"
    answer: "GamePlan requires a personal computer, either PC or Mac.  Tablets are not yet supported.  Like all graphical applications, you should use an external mouse.  Because GamePlan is a cloud application, an internet connection is required."
  - question: "Can GamePlan import data from other applications?"
    answer: "Yes. GamePlan can import data from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, and from Primavera P6 through a XER file."

    As the saying goes: "If you don\'t plan, you are planning to fail."
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Yet many builders still don\'t plan because, until now, planning tools have been hard to use. GamePlan changes that.  Anyone can plan in GamePlan. It\'s easy, it\'s fast, and many people say that GamePlan actually makes planning fun!

            Benefits of planning
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            When you plan your build, you know the exact move in date.  No more guestimating.  Yes, there will be unforseen delays, so you build these into the plan.  Then all you need to do is follow your plan and you\'ll deliver your project on time.  With much less stress.

<p class="u-fs-22">
    GamePlan creates a resource-leveled project schedule from the project plan.  A resource-leveled schedule is an achievable schedule because people are not double-booked.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    When any change is made to the plan, the schedule is automatically updated.
</p>

        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule tells you when all of your project deliverable dates will be achieved, so you can communicate these dates with confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule also shows your subcontractors when their tasks will be ready to work on.  This eliminates wasted time and keeps the project on track.

    title="Tracking"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Some builders don\'t plan because they believe that the plan quickly gets out of date.  This is true if you do not track your project.  When you track your project, your plan stays up to date.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">
    <div class="media-body">
        <h2>
            Benefits of Tracking
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking keeps your schedule valid, so that everyone can rely on the schedule.  When there\'s a delay or when a task takes longer than expected, the downstream schedule updates.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking the project also shows the project status. How far through the build are you?  When will it finish?  This information and more is always known.
