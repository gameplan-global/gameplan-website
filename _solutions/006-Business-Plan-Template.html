<p class="u-fs-22">
    Many people are involved in launching a business, so you need one plan that everyone works from.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    With GamePlan, everyone understands the plan because it\'s visual.  People stay focused on completing their tasks because they know their impact on the business launch.
</p>

            Benefits of planning
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning makes you consider all aspects of the new business ahead of time.  This is critical when so much is at stake.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Planning also shows the project\'s critical path (with red arrows).  These are the tasks that will impact the business start date if they run late.

    title="Scheduling"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    A schedule is mandatory because without a schedule you don\'t know when the business will be ready to launch, and people don\'t know when they\'re needed.
</p>
<p class="u-fs-22">
    GamePlan creates a resource-leveled project schedule as you visually plan, and shows it in a Gantt chart.  This is different to all other products, where you have to create the Gantt chart.  In GamePlan, the Gantt chart is created for you.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">

        <h2>
            Benefits of Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            The schedule shows you the earliest possible business launch date, and it shows people when to start and finish their tasks in order to achieve it.

    title="Tracking"
    content='
<p class="u-fs-22">
    Once execution of the plan starts, tracking keeps everything up to date.  Tracking is done by marking tasks as <i>Completed on Schedule</i> or entering timesheets.
</p>
<div class="media mt-4">
    <div class="media-body">
        <h2>
            Benefits of Tracking
        </h2>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking keeps the schedule valid, so that everyone can rely on it.  When there\'s a delay or when a task takes longer than expected, the downstream schedule automatically updates.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking shows the project status. What is the progress?  When will the new business be ready launch?  This information and more is always known.
        </p>
        <p class="u-fs-22">
            Tracking also gives you a permanent record of plan versus actuals.  Analysing this data in a project post-mortem is a valuable learning experience that improves future planning.
