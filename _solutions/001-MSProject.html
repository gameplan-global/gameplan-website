# FAQ data
#--------------------
faqs:
  - question: "So GamePlan visually shows my project workflow.  Does it do anything else?"
    answer: "Yes, communication is only one of the benefits of the visual workflow.  It also serves as an intuitive user interface to a powerful scheduling engine.  As you make changes on the Whiteboard, GamePlan updates the project schedule and displays it in GamePlan's Gantt chart."
  - question: "Can I move things around on the Whiteboard?"
    answer: "Absolutely!  Everyone has their preferred way of laying out their project plan, so GamePlan gives you complete flexibility.  You move tasks and groups with a simple drag and drop."
  - question: "Can I show large projects in GamePlan?"
    answer: "Yes.  However, there\'s a limit to the number of tasks that can be shown on a single Whiteboard before the tasks get too small to see.  Because large projects typically consist of multiple phases, the solution is to move different phases to different Whiteboards.  Links between phases will be preserved."
  - question: "Do I need special hardware to use GamePlan?"
    answer: "GamePlan requires a personal computer, either PC or Mac.  Tablets are not yet supported.  Like all graphical applications, you should use an external mouse.  Because GamePlan is a cloud application, an internet connection is required."
  - question: "Can GamePlan import data from other applications?"
    answer: "Yes. GamePlan can also import data from Microsoft Excel, and from Primavera P6 through a XER file."

    Let\'s be honest.  It\'s really hard to follow the task dependencies in a Gantt chart.  Now there\'s a solution.

            People make huge decisions based on Gantt charts.  But Gantt charts don\'t give an overall picture of the project.  Let GamePlan show you what\'s really going on in your project, so you make informed decisions.

<p class="u-fs-22">
    Research shows that 90% of spreadsheets contain errors.  This research has never been done on Gantt charts.  If it were, the results would be the same: almost all Gantt chart schedules contain unknown errors.

            We\'re willing to bet you\'ll see errors when you import your Project schedule.  We see errors in every file we import.  That\'s because errors in task dependencies are so hard to detect in a Gantt chart, and so easy to see in GamePlan.
