    Let\'s be honest.  It\'s really hard to follow the task dependencies in a Gantt chart.

            People make huge decisions based on Gantt charts.  But Gantt charts don\'t give an overall picture of the project.  Let GamePlan show you what\'s really going on in your project, so you make informed decisions.

<p class="u-fs-22">
    Research shows that 90% of spreadsheets contain errors.  This research has never been done on Gantt charts.  If it were, the results would be the same: almost all Gantt chart schedules contain unknown errors.

            We\'re willing to bet you\'ll see errors when you import your Project schedule.  We see errors in every file we import.  That\'s because errors in task dependencies are so hard to detect in a Gantt chart, and so easy to see in GamePlan.
